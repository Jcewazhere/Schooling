# Schooling
This is a sample of some of the projects I created while working on my Associates and Bachelor degrees. In addition to these samples of Visual Basic, Java, Assembly and C I've had classes in C++, C# and SQL. Most recently I've been modifying JSON, LUA and XML code in various games making mini personal mods for my own enjoyment and sense of game balance. They're not big enough, or changed enough from the developer's code, for me to publish but they have given me experience working on existing code rather than creating new code.
